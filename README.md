Java Project Version Control

Hi all! This is my sketch project or even demo, version control, for a large Java project. It integrates with gitlab ci-cd. Pipelines are created to collect the project and further index the hashes of all files. Next comes a simple check of these hashes in Python. As soon as the version has been updated, the isoshnik is assembled with the latest index.
